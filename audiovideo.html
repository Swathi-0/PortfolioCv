                <td> <p style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> “Spring Day” came out three years after the sinking of the Sewol ferry, a disaster in which an improperly inspected, overloaded, and unbalanced ferry capsized on an overnight journey. 
                    The ship had been loaded with twice the legal limit of cargo on its decks, and the ship’s crew had lied about the boat’s total weight. 
                    304 passengers, the majority of them high school students on the way to a sight-seeing field trip, drowned, as they had been ordered to stay in their cabins until it was too late.
                     Only 172 passengers survived the wreck.</p>
                    <P style="font-size: 1.5vw;">The disaster angered and traumatized the nation, but according to some reports, the South Korean government tried to silence entertainers who spoke out against it.
                         The Korean Ministry of Education even banned the disaster’s commemorative yellow ribbons in schools. 
                         Later, the president at the time of the disaster, Park Geun-hye, who was widely criticized for her government’s failure to prevent it, was impeached on charges of corruption.
            
                        But the nostalgic, longing tone of BTS’s “Spring Day” subtly helped keep the memory of the disaster alive in the minds of young Koreans and the media in the years after the tragedy.
                        The lyrics revolve around the themes of <B>loss, longing, grief,</B> and moving on.</P></td>

                    <P style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Often, when relationships end, the people involved have very different ideas of who was more at fault. 
                        In “exile” we are able to empathize with both sides, while not knowing which-- if either-- is being more honest about why the relationship ended. 
                        The story that Taylor and Justin tell here is a reminder that emotions are complex, and that real life isn’t always black and white. 
                        A relationship may end, but the feelings may take longer to fade. A relationship may wither, but it may be unclear why. 
                        That is why we need to have grace for ourselves and others as we deal with complex situations. 
                        Compassion and empathy can lead to understanding and growth, as we can see more clearly as outsiders to the scenario in “exile.”</P></td>
